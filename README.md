# Restart App

A quick learning project I made with the help of a tutorial to learn about really neat features in the iOS development ecosystem. Really clean UI with cool uses of AVfoundation including audio sounds for different scenarios. Also something really sweet is the animations I learned creating this app, making a super nice user experience.
